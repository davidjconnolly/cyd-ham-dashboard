## Hardware

Tested target:

- ESP32-2432S028R “Cheap Yellow Display”
- ESP32-WROOM based board
- ILI9341 320x240 TFT
- XPT2046 resistive touch controller

The included TFT_eSPI setup uses this common CYD wiring:

| Signal | GPIO |
| --- | ---: |
| TFT MISO | 12 |
| TFT MOSI | 13 |
| TFT SCLK | 14 |
| TFT CS | 15 |
| TFT DC | 2 |
| TFT RST | -1 |
| TFT backlight | 21 |
| Touch SCLK | 25 |
| Touch MOSI | 32 |
| Touch MISO | 39 |
| Touch CS | 33 |
| Touch IRQ | 36 |

Some CYD variants use different pins. If the display is blank, white, mirrored, or touch is wrong, check your board revision and adjust `include/User_Setup.h` and the touch constants in `src/dashboard_display.cpp`.

### Setup hotspot and factory reset

On first boot (or whenever no Wi-Fi is configured), the device broadcasts a `CYD-HamClock-Setup` access point (password `hamclock`) so you can join it and open the captive portal to enter your Wi-Fi details. Once the device confirms it has joined your network, the hotspot automatically switches off. To bring it back later — for example to reach the settings page again without your router — check "Keep the setup hotspot switched on" in the Station section of the web settings page.

The board's BOOT button (GPIO0, on the back next to the USB connector) doubles as a factory reset button: hold it down for 5 seconds while the dashboard is running to wipe all saved settings (Wi-Fi credentials, callsign, locator, timezone, data sources, brightness) and reboot to defaults. The screen shows a countdown while the button is held; release early to cancel.

## Flashing A Release Binary

If a `.bin` firmware file is attached to a GitHub release, you can flash it without building from source.

Install `esptool`:

```sh
python -m pip install esptool
```

Put the board into normal USB flashing mode, then flash the release binary. Replace `COM5` and the filename as needed:

```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COM5 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x10000 firmware.bin
```

If the release includes bootloader and partition binaries, use the release instructions for those exact offsets. For PlatformIO-built firmware, the application binary normally goes at `0x10000`.

After flashing, the board will start its setup access point if Wi-Fi is not configured.

## Building From Source

Install:

- VS Code
- PlatformIO extension
- USB serial driver for your ESP32 board if required

Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.

Copy the example config:

```sh
copy include\app_config.example.h include\app_config.h
```

On macOS/Linux:

```sh
cp include/app_config.example.h include/app_config.h
```

You may optionally edit `include/app_config.h` before flashing, but Wi-Fi and dashboard settings can also be configured from the captive portal or local web page.

Build:

```sh
pio run
```

Upload:

```sh
pio run -t upload
```

Open Serial Monitor:

```sh
pio device monitor
```

## First Boot And Wi-Fi Setup

The ESP32 starts a setup access point while also trying to connect to saved Wi-Fi credentials.

- AP name: `CYD-HamClock-Setup`
- AP password: `hamclock`
- Portal address: `http://192.168.4.1`

Join the setup AP from a phone or computer. The captive portal may open automatically. If it does not, browse to:

```text
http://192.168.4.1
```

The setup page lets you configure:

- Callsign
- Wi-Fi SSID and password
- Timezone preset, label, and POSIX timezone rule
- Maidenhead locator
- Propagation data source
- DX source mode, JSON URL, and Telnet host/port
- DX watchlist callsigns and alert behaviour
- Refresh intervals
- Backlight brightness
- Display colour swap and orientation (90-degree rotate, 180-degree flip) for differently wired CYD panels

Settings are saved to ESP32 Preferences and persist after reboot.
The saved Wi-Fi password is never displayed in the settings page. Leave the password field blank to keep it, or use the checkbox to clear it for an open network.

## Local Web Settings

When connected to Wi-Fi, the same settings page is available on your LAN:

```text
http://device-ip/
```

The clock page shows the current IP address. If mDNS starts successfully, this address may also work:

```text
http://cyd-ham.local/
```

Available routes:

- `GET /` - settings and status page
- `POST /save` - save settings
- `GET /status` - JSON status
- `POST /reboot` - restart the ESP32

This web UI is intended for a trusted local network. It does not include authentication.

## Touch Controls

- Tap left side: next page
- Tap right side: previous page
- Tap centre on HF Propagation or VHF Conditions page: manual propagation refresh
- Tap centre on DX Spots or DX Watch page: manual DX refresh

The footer shows Wi-Fi status, NTP status, and current page number.

## Dashboard Pages

### Clock

Shows:

- Large UTC time
- Configured local time
- Date
- Callsign and Maidenhead locator
- Device IP
- Uptime
- Wi-Fi/NTP/footer status

### HF Propagation

Fetches HamQSL data directly by default:

```text
https://www.hamqsl.com/solarxml.php
```

Displays:

- SFI
- A index
- K index
- X-Ray
- Sunspots
- Solar wind speed (SW) and magnetic-field Bz
- Geomag
- Noise
- Aurora
- HamQSL band condition groups for day/night
- Last update time and status

An optional JSON proxy URL can be configured from the web page.

### VHF Conditions

Same layout and data source as HF Propagation, sharing the same refresh cycle and JSON proxy setting.

Displays:

- SFI, A index, K index, X-Ray, Sunspots, Solar wind/Bz, Geomag, Noise, Aurora (identical top rows to HF Propagation)
- HamQSL VHF phenomena: VHF Aurora (with auroral latitude, when supplied), and E-Skip conditions for 6m Europe, 4m Europe, 2m Europe, and 2m North America
- Last update time and status

### Greyline

Calculates locally using the configured Maidenhead locator and NTP time.

Displays:

- Bitmap-style world map
- QTH marker
- Sun/subsolar marker
- Day/night terminator
- Night-side shading
- Sunrise, sunset, UTC time
- Location/daylight/greyline status

Changing the Maidenhead locator refreshes the Greyline calculations and map immediately; no reboot is required.

### DX Spots

Supports three source modes:

- `Auto` (default): try JSON first, then use Telnet if JSON fails or has no usable spots
- `JSON`: use only the configured JSON feed
- `Telnet`: maintain a connection to the configured DX Cluster

The default JSON endpoint is:

```text
https://web.cluster.iz3mez.it/spots.json
```

Displays recent spots with:

- Frequency
- Callsign
- Mode, inferred where possible
- UTC time
- Last update time and status

The default Telnet cluster is `dxspots.com:7300`. The configured station callsign is used for login, or `NOCALL` if no callsign is set. Both sources are configurable from the web settings page.

The device keeps the last good spot list when a refresh or connection fails. The DX page shows whether the active data came from JSON, Telnet, or the last good result.

Callsigns on the DX watchlist are drawn in green in the spot list.

### DX Watch

Monitors up to eight callsigns and announces them the moment they are spotted, so the dashboard can be left unattended while waiting for a DXpedition to come on the air.

Each watched callsign gets its own row showing whether it has been heard, and if so on what frequency, in what mode, and how long ago:

```text
Call         Freq     Mode   Age
3Y0J         14.074   FT8    4m
VP6D         not heard
FT8WW        21.023   CW     52m
```

A row is one of three states:

- Green call: heard within the active window, so the station is probably on the air now
- White call: heard, but longer ago than the active window
- Grey pattern: not heard since the device started

Configure the list in the web settings page under **DX Watchlist**. Separate callsigns with commas, spaces, or new lines:

```text
3Y0J, VP6D, FT8WW
```

Matching rules:

- `3Y0J` matches the bare call and any slash form, such as `3Y0J/MM` or `FT4/3Y0J`
- `VP6*` matches any call starting with `VP6`, for prefix hunting

Other settings:

- **Active for (minutes)**: how long after a spot the call counts as on the air. Default 15. Further spots inside this window update the row without alerting again, so a pileup does not alert repeatedly.
- **Flash the backlight on a new hit**: pulses the backlight three times. Default on.
- **Alert page jump**: switches the display to the DX Watch page on a new hit, held back for 15 seconds after a screen touch so it cannot interrupt you mid-tap. Default on.

Set **DX source mode** to `Auto` or `Telnet only` for expedition monitoring. A Telnet cluster streams every spot as it is posted, which is what makes the alert timely. JSON polling only reads the newest few spots each refresh and will miss most appearances; the DX Watch page shows a warning when JSON-only mode is selected.

Cluster-side filters set against your callsign login still apply, so the watchlist can be combined with a narrowed cluster feed.

#### History backfill

Live sources only report spots that arrive *after* the device connects, so a station spotted an hour ago leaves its row blank. The backfill closes that gap by seeding the rows from recent history at start-up, whenever the watchlist is edited, and on an interval.

The default source is DXSummit:

```text
http://www.dxsummit.fi/api/v1/spots?limit=500
```

DXSummit's API has no per-callsign filter, only a row limit, so the device pulls a wide window and matches it on the fly. The response is streamed and parsed one object at a time in bounded chunks across loop iterations, so memory stays flat and the display keeps rendering while it downloads.

Window sizes, measured against the live feed:

| `limit` | history covered | transfer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | ~9 minutes | 24 KB |
| 500 | ~45 minutes | 123 KB |
| 1000 | ~95 minutes | 246 KB |

Backfilled rows carry the spot's own timestamp, so a spot from 30 minutes ago reads `30m`, not `now`, and never raises an alert. A live spot always takes precedence over recovered history.

DXSummit's HTTPS endpoint is unreliable; the plain `http://` URL is used deliberately. Leave the field blank to disable the backfill.

Watch state is also published in `GET /status` as `dx_watch`, with backfill status in `dx_backfill`, for polling from a phone or another host on the LAN.

## Configuration Files

### `include/app_config.h`

Local default settings. Copy from `include/app_config.example.h`.

Useful defaults:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID "your-wifi-ssid"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your-wifi-password"
#define MAIDENHEAD_LOCATOR "FF46"
#define PROPAGATION_JSON_URL ""
#define DX_SPOTS_URL ""
```

Values saved through the captive portal or web settings page override most defaults at runtime.
When no DX URL has been saved, `DX_SPOTS_URL` is used if configured; otherwise the public IZ3MEZ endpoint is used.

### `include/User_Setup.h`

TFT_eSPI display configuration for the CYD hardware.

PlatformIO includes it automatically via:

```ini
build_flags =
  -D USER_SETUP_LOADED=1
  -include include/User_Setup.h
```

## Timezones

The web settings page includes common timezone presets. The firmware uses POSIX timezone strings.

UK default:

```text
GMT0BST-1,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0/2
```

UTC:

```text
UTC0
```

If your country is not listed, choose `Custom POSIX TZ` and enter a POSIX rule manually.

## Data Refresh

Default refresh intervals:

- HF Propagation: 15 minutes
- DX JSON: 5 minutes
- DX Telnet: persistent connection with reconnect attempts limited to once every 30 seconds
- Greyline calculations: once per minute
- Clock: once per second

Propagation and DX refresh intervals can be changed in the web settings page.

```

## Notes And Limits

- The setup AP remains available while the device runs.
- The web UI is for trusted LAN use only.
- Telnet reading is non-blocking; connection attempts use a short bounded timeout.
- SD card storage is not required.
- LVGL is not used.
- The embedded Greyline map uses flash space; current firmware size is close to the default app partition limit.
- The DX watchlist holds up to eight callsigns. Heard state lives in RAM and is cleared by a restart.
- Watch ages use the spot's own timestamp where the source provides one, falling back to when the device saw it.
- The backfill only reaches as far back as its window. A station last spotted before that window shows as not heard until it appears again.
- A watched call absent from both the cluster and DXSummit is not being spotted anywhere; check the callsign before assuming a device fault.

## Troubleshooting

### Display is blank or white

Check that your CYD uses the same display pins as `include/User_Setup.h`.

### Touch is inaccurate

The touch calibration constants are in `src/dashboard_display.cpp`. CYD touch panels vary slightly.

### Time does not sync

Check Wi-Fi status and confirm your network allows NTP. The footer shows `NTP OK` when synced.

### Web page does not open

Check the IP shown on the clock page and browse to:

```text
http://that-ip/
```

If `cyd-ham.local` does not resolve, use the IP address instead.

### Propagation or DX shows fetch failed

Confirm Wi-Fi is connected and that your network allows HTTPS requests to the configured data source.
